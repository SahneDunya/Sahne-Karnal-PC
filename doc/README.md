# Sahne-Karnal
Sahne Karnal is a kernel family developed by Sahne D端nya. Sahne D端nya also developed this project through an independent operating system project. Many operating systems use Linux kernels, most operating systems that use their own kernels have a Unix infrastructure, but very few operating systems use both their own kernel and their own infrastructure. Sahne Karnal falls into this percentage. What are the features of Sahne Karnal? First of all, Sahne Karnal uses the Rust programming language instead of C, which is the programming language used by many operating systems. In this way, it can benefit from modern features. Sahne Karnal is closer to the Micro Architecture, where the basic operating system services are located in the kernel space. Sahne Karnal architecture does not have a specific API for kernel-user space communication, but when choosing an external API, look for Karnal64 compatibility! What is Karnal64? Karnal64 is the Internal Kernel Services Export API. Sahne D端nya does not only do this in the Sahne Karnal series, it also offers Standard User Space components for some components. These are executable file: .gaxe, file system: SADAK, Package manager: Sahne D端nya Packet Liders, User space and kernel communication: Sahne64 API. But not all, for example this kernel does not offer Standard Desktop Environment, Window system, Sound system, Device drivers, launch system etc. Also Sahne Karnal is an open source kernel. It is published under MIT License. Sahne Karnal offers a single version as standard, but there may be thousands of non-standard versions like Linux. You are currently in Standard Edition. There are many striking features in Standard Edition, it is compatible with both Desktop and Mobile.
